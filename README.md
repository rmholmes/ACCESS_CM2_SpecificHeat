# ACCESS_CM2_SpecificHeat
Contains data and code to plot specific heat properties from ACCESS-CM2 PI control output.

ACCESS_SpecificHeat.m contains the plotting code.

ACCESS_SpecificHeat_PIcontrol_SWP.mat contains processed data from the ACCESS-CM2 PI control run. 

While most of the raw data is freely available on the [CMIP6 ESGF website](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/cmip6/), the hfds surface heat flux variable for ACCESS-CM2 in that archive is not complete. Here we use a complete version from the raw ACCESS-CM2 output available on the National Computational Institute.
